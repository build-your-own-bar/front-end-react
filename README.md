# Initial Planning

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to save my list of drinks in my profile when I sign in so I can keep track of my favorite concoctions.
- As a user, I want to be able to create my preferences on a specific cocktail on the menu so the bartender knows how to prepare my drink.
- As a user, I want to plug in my birthday to see if I’m old enough to enter the site.
- As a user, I want to be able to see all the created cocktails.
- As a user, I would like to update and push a cocktail into my own menu.

Stretch:

- As a user, I would like to view other members’ profiles so I can see their favorite drinks and preferences.
