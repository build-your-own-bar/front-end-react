> BYOBar was designed by three developers who have a passion for connecting with others and making people feel like they're part of the family. With our app, we are able to give that experience to you, the user, and you are always able to show off your style and preferences in cocktail form!

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to create my preferences on a specific cocktail on the menu so the bartender knows how to prepare my drink.
- As a user, I want to plug in my birthday to see if I’m old enough to enter the site.
- As a user, I want to be able to see all the created cocktails.
- As a user, I would like to update and push a cocktail into my own menu.

Stretch:

### Unsolved Problems / Major Hurdles

> The biggest hurdle we faced was getting the Comment section of each drink to work the way we wanted it to. We had some strange interactions with our backend and spent the most time debugging this. We did end up fixing it though!
